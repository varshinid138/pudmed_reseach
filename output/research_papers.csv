40080036,Clinical Spectrum of Toxocariasis: A Retrospective Study From a Tertiary Care Center in Lebanon.,2025 Mar 13,N/A,N/A,"Study looked at cases of toxocariasis at a hospital in Lebanon between 2002 and 2022. Most patients (78.5%) had symptoms on presentation, with many complaining of neurological symptoms including headache, numbness or weakness. The majority of the infected patients were Lebanese (95.3%) and lived in specific areas of Lebanon. Because diagnosing this disease can be difficult, more research is needed to better understand it in Lebanon and the wider Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region."

Data from 6 SWOG Cancer Research Network trials across prostate, lung, and pancreatic cancers that recruited patients aged 65 years or older from 1999 to 2014 were linked with Medicare claims data. The study included 1429 patients (median age, 71 years [range, 65-91 years]; 1123 men [78.6%]; and 332 patients [23.5%) with rural residence). The median number of contact days was 48 (IQR, 26-71), of a median of 350 days of observation."
40079977,Retractions in Otolaryngology Publications.,2025 Mar 13,N/A,N/A,"40079977 2025 03 13 2168-619X 2025 Mar 13 JAMA otolaryngology-- head &amp; neck surgery JAMA Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg Retractions in Otolaryngology Publications. 10.1001/jamaoto.2025.0018 To characterize trends in otolaryngology (ear, nose, and throat [ENT]) retractions, identify underlying causes, and compare retraction rates with similar specialties. A scoping review of retracted articles published from January 1, 1974, through December 31, 2023, was carried out. Retraction data were obtained from the Crossref/Retraction Watch database and corresponding abstracts were retrieved from PubMed. Publication data were obtained from Scopus. All retracted articles related to ENT were identified. Articles from neurosurgery and ophthalmology were similarly retrieved for comparison. Articles withdrawn for routine updates, expressions of concern, reinstatements, and corrections were excluded. The data were obtained on December 3, 2024. The primary outcomes were annual retraction rate (proportion of retracted articles per total published articles) and reasons for retraction (categorized as intentional data misconduct, intentional procedural misconduct, unintentional data errors, unintentional procedural errors, or unknown). Secondary measures included time from publication to retraction and comparisons with neurosurgery and ophthalmology retraction rates. Of 481&#x202f;215 ENT articles, 471 (0.10%) were retracted. Retractions increased over time, peaking in 2022 with a retraction rate of 0.42%. Among retracted ENT articles, the most common reasons were intentional data misconduct (233 [49.50%]) and intentional procedural misconduct (210 [44.60%]). Articles with first authors from China accounted for the largest share (243 [51.60%]) of these retractions. Basic science head and neck cancer research represented the largest subspecialty category (161 [34.20%]). The median (IQR) time to retraction was 21.8 (10.8-55.3) months. This analysis found that retractions in ENT literature have increased over 5 decades, predominantly driven by intentional misconduct. These findings highlight the need for enhanced oversight, training, and editorial vigilance to maintain the integrity of ENT research and protect patient welfare.

A 62-year-old man sought evaluation for a severely painful, deeply ulcerated lesion on the floor of the mouth. Two previous oral biopsies revealed nonspecific ulceration with inflammation. Despite these inconclusive results, a head and neck surgeon had advocated resection of the floor of the mouth due to a high suspicion for malignancy. One month after the outbreak of the oral ulceration, the patient developed a widespread cutaneous rash. Cutaneous biopsy and serologic studies confirmed a diagnosis of syphilis. The patient was subsequently treated with a 30-day regimen of oral doxycycline due to a penicillin allergy. At a 3-week follow-up, there was nearly complete resolution of the oral and cutaneous lesions.

The most severe clinical manifestation of CVI is venous leg ulcer (VLU), which leads to substantial morbidity and disability. VLUs can present in both typical and atypical forms. However, several other types of leg ulcers can mimic VLUs. Therefore, vascular and wound care specialists must recognize the variability in VLU presentation and understand the differential diagnoses to deliver an accurate diagnosis and optimal care of atypical VLUs and conditions that resemble VLUs. Herein, we review and discuss the broad differential diagnosis of VLUs, supported by illustrative examples. Kolluri Raghu R 0000-0002-4374-7513 OhioHealth Heart and Vascular, Columbus, OH, USA.

The presence of neuropathy with loss of protective sensation and/or peripheral arterial disease are essential risk factors for diabetic foot ulcers. Prevention aims at identifying the foot at risk, regularly checking the foot at risk, educating patients, relatives and healthcare professionals, ensuring the routine wearing of appropriate footwear and treating risk factors for ulceration. In the presence of a diabetic foot ulcer, therapy consists of a combination of mechanical relief (gold standard during the ulcer phase: total contact cast), treatment of peripheral arterial disease, treatment of infections, metabolic control and treatment of comorbidities, local ulcer control and education of patients and relatives. Infected ulcers must be examined for the presence of osteomyelitis. Without osteomyelitis, therapy consists of local debridement and 1-2 weeks of antibiotic therapy. If osteomyelitis is present, therapy consists either of a combination of surgical therapy (amputation vs. internal resection) with accompanying short antibiotic therapy or of purely conservative therapy with 6 weeks of antibiotics. After the ulcer has healed, orthopedic shoe care is indicated to prevent recurrence. &#xa9; 2024 Aerzteverlag medinfo AG.

A 62-year-old man sought evaluation for a severely painful, deeply ulcerated lesion on the floor of the mouth. Two previous oral biopsies revealed nonspecific ulceration with inflammation. Despite these inconclusive results, a head and neck surgeon had advocated resection of the floor of the mouth due to a high suspicion for malignancy. One month after the outbreak of the oral ulceration, the patient developed a widespread cutaneous rash. Cutaneous biopsy and serologic studies confirmed a diagnosis of syphilis. The patient was subsequently treated with a 30-day regimen of oral doxycycline due to a penicillin allergy. At a 3-week follow-up, there was nearly complete resolution of the oral and cutaneous lesions. Early recognition and establishment of a correct diagnosis of syphilis may lead to timely pharmaceutical intervention, avoidance of unnecessary surgical intervention, improved patient outcomes, and reduction of disease transmission.

The patient also reported anxiety and difficulty sleeping. Cone beam computed tomography revealed impacted maxillary third molars and hypertrophy of the nasal turbinates. An auriculotemporal nerve block performed with 2% lidocaine decreased the pain but did not eliminate it, suggesting that the TMJ was not the primary source of the patient's pain. At a follow-up appointment 24 hours after the nerve block, infiltration anesthesia was administered via a simple buccal injection at the level of the impacted left third molar. The infiltration anesthesia completely eliminated the TMJ pain, indicating that the patient was experiencing referred pain (also known as heterotopic pain). The patient's anxiety and disordered sleep (possibly the result of hypopnea arising from hypertrophic nasal turbinates) could have produced a central hypersensitivity that initiated or exacerbated the referred pain. The patient was advised to consult an otorhinolaryngologist to evaluate her respiratory and sleep problems and a psychiatrist to evaluate her anxiety state. In addition, extraction of the third molars and continued dental follow-up were proposed. Dentists may encounter patients with chronic referred pain in daily practice. Additional research is needed to better understand the mechanisms of referred pain and contributory psychological factors, which would allow dentists to identify and apply the best treatment strategies for these patients.
